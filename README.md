# ACM Cyber website

This repository contains the code for ACM Cyber website.
The live portal is viewable at:
[cyber.acmucsd.com](https://cyber.acmucsd.com/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Development

1. Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Populate `.env`. You'll need to get its contents from someone.

   TODO: Where should we put our `.env` file?

1. Then run the development server:

   ```shell
   $ npm run dev
   ```

   Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.
